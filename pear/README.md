## Introduction

This module installs PEAR from a package manager and aids you in installing
the latest versions (or specified versions) of PEAR packages.

## Credit

This code is taken from https://gist.github.com/305778, which is itself based on

## Example usage

This module will try to install PEAR via the package name `php-pear` (this is
also configurable) and will then allow the installation of PEAR packages
through the pear::package function.

Here is an example of installing the default `php-pear` package and upgrading
PEAR, then installing Console_Table and finally installing drush 4.5.0 from a
third-party PEAR repository, pear.drush.org.

```puppet
include pear

# If no version number is supplied, the latest stable release will be
# installed. In this case, upgrade PEAR to 1.9.2+ so it can use
# pear.drush.org without complaint.
pear::package { "PEAR": }
pear::package { "Console_Table": }

# Version numbers are supported.
pear::package { "drush":
  version => "4.5.0",
  repository => "pear.drush.org",
}
```

Alternately, to specify a different package for PEAR (if you are using IUS
on CentOS, for example) you can invoke the class using the parameterized
class syntax instead of an `include`.

```puppet
class { "pear":
  package => "php52-pear",
  require => Package["php52-cli"],
}

# If no version number is supplied, the latest stable release will be
# installed. In this case, upgrade PEAR to 1.9.2+ so it can use
# pear.drush.org without complaint.
pear::package { "PEAR": }
pear::package { "Console_Table": }

# Version numbers are supported.
# Also, make sure PEAR is upgraded before trying to install drush.
pear::package { "drush":
  version => "4.5.0",
  repository => "pear.drush.org",
  require => Pear::Package["PEAR"],
}
```
