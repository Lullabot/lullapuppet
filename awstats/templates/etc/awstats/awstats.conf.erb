# AWSTATS CONFIGURE FILE 6.8
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copy this file into awstats.www.mydomain.conf and edit this new config file
# to setup AWStats (See documentation in docs/ directory).
# The config file must be in /etc/awstats, /usr/local/etc/awstats or /etc (for
# Unix/Linux) or same directory than awstats.pl (Windows, Mac, Unix/Linux...)
# To include an environment variable in any parameter (AWStats will replace
# it with its value when reading it), follow the example:
# Parameter="__ENVNAME__"
# Note that environment variable AWSTATS_CURRENT_CONFIG is always defined with
# the config value in an AWStats running session and can be used like others.

# If there are several log files from load balancing servers :
# Example: "/pathtotools/logresolvemerge.pl *.log |"
#
LogFile="<%= @logfile %>"


# Enter the log file type you want to analyze.
# Possible values:
#  W - For a web log file

# 1 - Apache or Lotus Notes/Domino native combined log format (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format)
# 2 - IIS or ISA format (IIS W3C log format). See FAQ-COM115 For ISA.
# 3 - Webstar native log format.
# 4 - Apache or Squid native common log format (NCSA common/CLF log format)
#     With LogFormat=4, some features (browsers, os, keywords...) can't work.
# "your_own_personalized_log_format" = If your log is ftp, mail or other format,
#     you must use following keys to define the log format string (See FAQ for
#     ftp, mail or exotic web log format examples):
#   %host             Client hostname or IP address (or Sender host for mail log)
#   %host_r           Receiver hostname or IP address (for mail log)
#   %lognamequot      Authenticated login/user with format: "john"

#   %virtualname      Web sever virtual hostname. Use this tag when same log
#                     contains data of several virtual web servers. AWStats
#                     will discard records not in SiteDomain nor HostAliases
#   %cluster          If log file is provided from several computers (merged by
#                     logresolvemerge.pl), use this to define cluster id field.
#   %extraX           Another field that you plan to use for building a
#                     personalized report with ExtraSection feature (See later).
#   If your log format has some fields not included in this list, use:
#   %other            Means another not used field
#   %otherquot        Means another not used double quoted field
#
# Examples for Apache combined logs (following two examples are equivalent):
# LogFormat = 1
# LogFormat = "%host %other %logname %time1 %methodurl %code %bytesd %refererquot %uaquot"
#
# Example for IIS:
# LogFormat = 2
#
LogFormat=<%= @logformat %>


# If your log field's separator is not a space, you can change this parameter.
# This parameter is not used if LogFormat is a predefined value (1,2,3,4)
# Backslash can be used as escape character.
# Example: " "
# Example: "\t"
# Example: "\|"
# Example: ","
# Default: " "
#
LogSeparator="<%= @logseparator %>"


# "SiteDomain" must contain the main domain name, or the main intranet web
# server name, used to reach the web site.
# If you share the same log file for several virtual web servers, this
# parameter is used to tell AWStats to filter record that contains records for
# this virtual host name only (So check that this virtual hostname can be
# found in your log file and use a personalized log format that include the
# %virtualname tag).
# But for multi hosting a better solution is to have one log file for each
# virtual web server. In this case, this parameter is only used to generate
# full URL's links when ShowLinksOnUrl option is set to 1.
# If analyzing mail log, enter here the domain name of mail server.
# Example: "myintranetserver"
# Example: "www.domain.com"
# Example: "ftp.domain.com"
# Example: "domain.com"
#
SiteDomain="<%= @sitedomain %>"


# Enter here all other possible domain names, addresses or virtual host
# aliases someone can use to access your site. Try to keep only the minimum
# number of possible names/addresses to have the best performances.
# You can repeat the "SiteDomain" value in this list.
# This parameter is used to analyze referer field in log file and to help
# AWStats to know if a referer URL is a local URL of same site or an URL of
# another site.
# Note: Use space between each value.
# Note: You can use regular expression values writing value with REGEX[value].
# Note: You can also use @/mypath/myfile if list of aliases are in a file.
# Example: "www.myserver.com localhost 127.0.0.1 REGEX[mydomain\.(net|org)$]"
#
HostAliases="<%= @hostaliases %>


# If you want to have hosts reported by name instead of ip address, AWStats
# need to make reverse DNS lookups (if not already done in your log file).
# With DNSLookup to 0, all hosts will be reported by their IP addresses and
# not by the full hostname of visitors (except if names are already available
# in log file).
# If you want/need to set DNSLookup to 1, don't forget that this will reduce
# dramatically AWStats update process speed. Do not use on large web sites.
# Note: Reverse DNS lookup is done on IPv4 only (Enable ipv6 plugin for IPv6).
# Note: Result of DNS Lookup can be used to build the Country report. However
# it is highly recommanded to enable the plugin 'geoip' or 'geoipfree' to
# have an accurate Country report with no need of DNS Lookup.
# Possible values:
# 0 - No DNS Lookup
# 1 - DNS Lookup is fully enabled
# 2 - DNS Lookup is made only from static DNS cache file (if it exists)
# Default: 2
# 
DNSLookup=<%= @dnslookup %>


# When AWStats updates its statistics, it stores results of its analysis in 
# files (AWStats database). All those files are written in the directory
# defined by the "DirData" parameter. Set this value to the directory where
# you want AWStats to save its database and working files into.
# Warning: If you want to be able to use the "AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser"
# feature (see later), you need "Write" permissions by web server user on this
# directory (and "Modify" for Windows NTFS file systems).
# Example: "/var/lib/awstats"
# Example: "../data"
# Example: "C:/awstats_data_dir"
# Default: "."          (means same directory as awstats.pl)
#
DirData="<%= @dirdata %>"


# Relative or absolute web URL of your awstats cgi-bin directory.
# This parameter is used only when AWStats is run from command line
# with -output option (to generate links in HTML reported page).
# Example: "/awstats"
# Default: "/cgi-bin"   (means awstats.pl is in "/yourwwwroot/cgi-bin")
#
DirCgi="<%= @dircgi %>"


# Relative or absolute web URL of your awstats icon directory.
# If you build static reports ("... -output > outputpath/output.html"), enter
# path of icon directory relative to the output directory 'outputpath'.
# Example: "/awstatsicons"
# Example: "../icon"
# Default: "/icon" (means you must copy icon directories in "/mywwwroot/icon")
#
DirIcons="<%= @diricons %>"


# When this parameter is set to 1, AWStats adds a button on report page to
# allow to "update" statistics from a web browser. Warning, when "update" is
# made from a browser, AWStats is run as a CGI by the web server user defined
# in your web server (user "nobody" by default with Apache, "IUSR_XXX" with
# IIS), so the "DirData" directory and all already existing history files
# awstatsMMYYYY[.xxx].txt must be writable by this user. Change permissions if
# necessary to "Read/Write" (and "Modify" for Windows NTFS file systems).
# Warning: Update process can be long so you might experience "time out"
# browser errors if you don't launch AWStats frequently enough.
# When set to 0, update is only made when AWStats is run from the command
# line interface (or a task scheduler).
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser=<%= @allowtoupdatestatsfrombrowser %>


# AWStats saves and sorts its database on a month basis (except if using
# databasebreak option from command line). 
# However, if you choose the -month=all from command line or
# value '-Year-' from CGI combo form to have a report for all year, AWStats
# needs to reload all data for full year (each month), and sort them,
# requiring a large amount of time, memory and CPU. This might be a problem
# for web hosting providers that offer AWStats for large sites, on shared
# servers, to non CPU cautious customers.
# For this reason, the 'full year' is only enabled on Command Line by default.
# You can change this by setting this parameter to 0, 1, 2 or 3.
# Possible values:
#  0 - Never allowed
#  1 - Allowed on CLI only, -Year- value in combo is not visible
#  2 - Allowed on CLI only, -Year- value in combo is visible but not allowed
#  3 - Possible on CLI and CGI
# Default: 2
#
AllowFullYearView=<%= @allowfullyearview %>



#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTIONAL SETUP SECTION (Not required but increase AWStats features)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# When the update process runs, AWStats can set a lock file in TEMP or TMP
# directory. This lock is to avoid to have 2 update processes running at the
# same time to prevent unknown conflicts problems and avoid DoS attacks when
# AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser is set to 1.
# Because, when you use lock file, you can experience sometimes problems in
# lock file not correctly removed (killed process for example requires that
# you remove the file manualy), this option is not enabled by default (Do
# not enable this option with no console server access).
# Change : Effective immediatly
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
EnableLockForUpdate=<%= @enablelockforupdate %>


# AWStats can do reverse DNS lookups through a static DNS cache file that was
# previously created manually. If no path is given in static DNS cache file
# name, AWStats will search DirData directory. This file is never changed.
# This option is not used if DNSLookup=0.
# Note: DNS cache file format is 'minsince1970 ipaddress resolved_hostname'
# or just 'ipaddress resolved_hostname'
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "/mydnscachedir/dnscache"
# Default: "dnscache.txt"
#
DNSStaticCacheFile="<%= @dnsstaticcachefile %>"


# AWStats can do reverse DNS lookups through a DNS cache file that was created
# by a previous run of AWStats. This file is erased and recreated after each
# statistics update process. You don't need to create and/or edit it.
# AWStats will read and save this file in DirData directory.
# This option is used only if DNSLookup=1.
# Note: If a DNSStaticCacheFile is available, AWStats will check for DNS
# lookup in DNSLastUpdateCacheFile after checking into DNSStaticCacheFile.
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "/mydnscachedir/dnscachelastupdate"
# Default: "dnscachelastupdate.txt"
#
DNSLastUpdateCacheFile="<%= @dnslastupdatecachefile %>"


# You can specify specific IP addresses that should NOT be looked up in DNS.
# This option is used only if DNSLookup=1.
# Note: Use space between each value.
# Note: You can use regular expression values writing value with REGEX[value].
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "123.123.123.123 REGEX[^192\.168\.]"
# Default: ""
#
SkipDNSLookupFor="<%= @skipdnslookupfor %>"


# The following two parameters allow you to protect a config file from being
# read by AWStats when called from a browser if web user has not been
# authenticated. Your AWStats program must be in a web protected "realm" (With

# your server setup manual).
# Change : Effective immediatly
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
AllowAccessFromWebToAuthenticatedUsersOnly=<%= @allowaccessfromwebtoauthenticatedusersonly %>


# This parameter gives the list of all authorized authenticated users to view

# Change : Effective immediatly
# Example: "127.0.0.1 123.123.123.1-123.123.123.255"
# Default: ""
#
AllowAccessFromWebToFollowingIPAddresses="<%= @allowaccessfromwebtofollowingipaddresses %>"


# If the "DirData" directory (see above) does not exist, AWStats return an
# error. However, you can ask AWStats to create it.
# This option can be used by some Web Hosting Providers that has defined a 
# dynamic value for DirData (for example DirData="/home/__REMOTE_USER__") and
# don't want to have to create a new directory each time they add a new user.
# Change : Effective immediatly
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
CreateDirDataIfNotExists=<%= @createdirdataifnotexists %>


# You can choose in which format the Awstats history database is saved.

# Default: text
#
BuildHistoryFormat=<%= @buildhistoryformat %>


# If you prefer having the report output pages be built as XML compliant pages

# Possible values: html or xhtml
# Default: html
#
BuildReportFormat=<%= @buildreportformat %>


# AWStats databases can be updated from command line of from a browser (when
# used as a cgi program). So AWStats database files need write permission
# for both command line user and default web server user (nobody for Unix,
# IUSR_xxx for IIS/Windows,...).
# To avoid permission problems between update process (run by an admin user)
# and CGI process (ran by a low level user), AWStats can save its database 
# files with read and write permissions for everyone.
# By default, AWStats keeps default user permissions on updated files. If you 
# set AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser to 1, you can change this parameter to 1.
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
SaveDatabaseFilesWithPermissionsForEveryone=<%= @savedatabasefileswithpermissionsforeveryone %>


# AWStats can purge log file, after analyzing it. Note that AWStats is able
# to detect new lines in a log file, to process only them, so you can launch
# AWStats as often as you want, even with this parameter to 0.
# With 0, no purge is made, so you must use a scheduled task or a web server
# that make this purge frequently.
# With 1, the purge of the log file is made each time AWStats update is run.
# This parameter doesn't work with IIS (This web server doesn't let its log
# file to be purged).
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
PurgeLogFile=<%= @purgelogfile %>


# When PurgeLogFile is setup to 1, AWStats will clean your log file after
# processing it. You can however keep an archive file of all processed log
# records by setting this parameter (For example if you want to use another

# awstats_archive.configname[.suffix].log
# This parameter is not used if PurgeLogFile=0

# Example: 1
# Example: %YYYY%MM%DD
# Default: 0
#
ArchiveLogRecords=<%= @archivelogrecords %>


# Each time you run the update process, AWStats overwrites the 'historic file'
# for the month (awstatsMMYYYY[.*].txt) with the updated one.
# When write errors occurs (IO, disk full,...), this historic file can be
# corrupted and must be deleted. Because this file contains information of all
# past processed log files, you will loose old stats if removed. So you can

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EXTRA SECTIONS
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# You can define your own charts, you choose here what are rows and columns
# keys. This feature is particularly useful for marketing purpose, tracking
# products orders for example.
# For this, edit all parameters of Extra section. Each set of parameter is a
# different chart. For several charts, duplicate section changing the number.
# Note: Each Extra section reduces AWStats speed by 8%.
#
# WARNING: A wrong setup of Extra section might result in too large arrays
# that will consume all your memory, making AWStats unusable after several
# updates, so be sure to setup it correctly.
# In most cases, you don't need this feature.
#
# ExtraSectionNameX is title of your personalized chart.
# ExtraSectionCodeFilterX is list of codes the record code field must match.
#   Put an empty string for no test on code.
# ExtraSectionConditionX are conditions you can use to count or not the hit,
#   Use one of the field condition
#   (URL,URLWITHQUERY,QUERY_STRING,REFERER,UA,HOSTINLOG,HOST,VHOST,extraX)
#   and a regex to match, after a coma. Use "||" for "OR".
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnTitleX is the first column title of the chart.
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnValuesX is a string to tell AWStats which field to
#   extract value from
#   (URL,URLWITHQUERY,QUERY_STRING,REFERER,UA,HOSTINLOG,HOST,VHOST,extraX)
#   and how to extract the value (using regex syntax). Each different value
#   found will appear in first column of report on a different row. Be sure
#   that list of different possible values will not grow indefinitely.
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnFormatX is the string used to write value.
# ExtraSectionStatTypesX are things you want to count. You can use standard
#   code letters (P for pages,H for hits,B for bandwidth,L for last access).
# ExtraSectionAddAverageRowX add a row at bottom of chart with average values.
# ExtraSectionAddSumRowX add a row at bottom of chart with sum values.
# MaxNbOfExtraX is maximum number of rows shown in chart.
# MinHitExtraX is minimum number of hits required to be shown in chart.
#

# Example to report the 20 products the most ordered by "order.cgi" script
#ExtraSectionName1="Product orders"
#ExtraSectionCodeFilter1="200 304"
#ExtraSectionCondition1="URL,\/cgi\-bin\/order\.cgi||URL,\/cgi\-bin\/order2\.cgi"
#ExtraSectionFirstColumnTitle1="Product ID"
#ExtraSectionFirstColumnValues1="QUERY_STRING,productid=([^&]+)"
#ExtraSectionFirstColumnFormat1="%s"
#ExtraSectionStatTypes1=PL
#ExtraSectionAddAverageRow1=0
#ExtraSectionAddSumRow1=1
#MaxNbOfExtra1=20
#MinHitExtra1=1


# There is also a global parameter ExtraTrackedRowsLimit that limits the
# number of possible rows an ExtraSection can report. This parameter is
# here to protect too much memory use when you make a bad setup in your
# ExtraSection. It applies to all ExtraSection independently meaning that
# none ExtraSection can report more rows than value defined by ExtraTrackedRowsLimit.
# If you know an ExtraSection will report more rows than its value, you should
# increase this parameter or AWStats will stop with an error.
# Example: 2000
# Default: 500
#
ExtraTrackedRowsLimit=<%= @extratrackedrowslimit %>


#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# INCLUDES
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# You can include other config files using the directive with the name of the
# config file.
# This is particularly useful for users who have a lot of virtual servers, so
# a lot of config files and want to maintain common values in only one file.
# Note that when a variable is defined both in a config file and in an
# included file, AWStats will use the last value read for parameters that
# contains one value and AWStats will concat all values from both files for
# parameters that are lists of values.
#

Include "/etc/awstats/awstats.conf.local"
