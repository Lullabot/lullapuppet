This repo is a collection of generic modules. It is designed to be cloned
to /usr/share/puppet/modules, which by default is the secondary location that
puppet will look for modules. This allows for another repo to be used for
custom modules and node manifests to glue everything together in /etc/puppet.

git clone git@github.com:Lullabot/lullapuppet.git /usr/share/puppet/modules
