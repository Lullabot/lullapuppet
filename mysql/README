mysql::server installs, and attempts to optimize the MySQL server. If no
innodb_buffer_pool_size parameter is specified, 37.5% of the total server
memory is allocated. This is based on the assumption that the server is not
a dedicated MySQL server. If a specific buffer pool size is required, just
set the parameter.
