This puppet module is meant to be used during a Vagrant box provisioning. It
pulls various config files from a user's local home directory and copies them
into the vagrant environment. This allows users to use Vagrant while
maintaining all of their local settings (such as .vimrc).

In order for this to work, The following configuration needs to be included in
the Vagrantfile for the box(es) being provisioned with this module.

    config.vm.synced_folder "~/", "/vhome"
